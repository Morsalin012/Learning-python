# 🐍 Learning Python

Welcome to my Python learning journey! This repository contains exercises, notes, and mini-projects as I explore the fundamentals of Python programming.

## 🚀 Goals

- Build a strong foundation in Python syntax and logic
- Practice with functions, loops, string manipulation, and formatting
- Solve coding challenges and understand core concepts deeply
- Document progress and share learnings

## 📁 Structure

- `functions/` – Practice with defining and using functions
- `strings/` – Exercises on string methods and formatting
- `loops/` – Iteration and control flow examples
- `projects/` – Small projects applying what I've learned

## 🧠 Why This Repo?

I'm using this space to:
- Reinforce my understanding through hands-on coding
- Track my growth and reflect on challenges
- Share examples that might help other learners

## 🛠️ Tools

- Python 3.x
- VS Code / Jupyter Notebook
- Git for version control

Happy coding! 💻
